# Method
Prepare:
Make the levain in advance. Begin this recipe when it is 1 hour from its peak.

1. Autolyse the dough. What this means: mix all of the flour (400 g bread and 50 g WW) with all but 25 g of the water until there are no dry spots. Cover and leave for an hour.
2. Incorporate the levain and salt. Fill a bowl with 25 g of water. Spread the levain over the dough with wet hands. Splash a bit of water
