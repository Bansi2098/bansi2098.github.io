Pizza for the poor peasants who don't have pizza ovens or pizza stones. What we do have, though, is spunk.

I broil this pizza on a cast-iron skillet for about 5 minutes and it's alright.

# Method
Prepare:
You will need 80 g active sourdough starter to begin this recipe. I usually make this the night ahead.

1. When your starter is ready, pour all 320 g of warm water into a bowl and drop the starter in. Mix.
2. Mix in the salt.
