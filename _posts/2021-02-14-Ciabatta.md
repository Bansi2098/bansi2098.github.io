Ciabatta is the Italian answer to the French baguette. It is a great bread for panini. It's a rather challenging bread due to the high hydration of the dough, which makes mixing, shaping, and preparing the bake difficult.

My recipe is rather low hydration for a ciabatta - only 73% water (baker's percentage). I also prefer to make square rolls which are convenient for sandwiches. These small changes make the baking process easier without compromising the flavor.
