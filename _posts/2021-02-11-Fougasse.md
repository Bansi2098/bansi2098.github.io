Use flaky salt and crumbled oregano leaves for topping.

# Method
Start with a large bowl filled with all but 20 g of the water.
1. Add the levain to the bowl. Mix until the starter is mostly broken apart.
2. Add the salt. Mix.
3. Add all of the flours to the bowl. Mix by hand or machine until the dough comes together. 
4. Add the olive oil. Mix until the olive oil is incorporated. Add the remaining 20 g of water if the dough seems firm.
5. Mix until mild gluten development (mostly smooth dough).
6. Cover and rest.
7. Apply 4 stretch-and-folds at 30 minute intervals, starting 30 minutes after the last step.
8. Immediately after the last stretch-and-fold, grease your pan with a generous amount of olive oil. Place the dough in the the greased pan and cover.
9. Let rise 4 hours, or until the dough is well-risen and soft to the touch.
10. Brush the dough with a light coating of olive oil and sprinkle some flaky salt. Add your toppings.
11. Bake at 400F/200C convection, or 425F/220C regular, for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
