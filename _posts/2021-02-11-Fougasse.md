# Method
1. Proof the 1 tsp yeast in 350 mL warm water.
2. Mix in the 1.5 tsp salt. 
3. Gradually mix in the 500 g flour, kneading by hand or machine until all the flour is picked up.
4. Add the 2 tsp olive oil and keep kneading until the dooth is mostly smooth, about 4 minutes by mixer.
5. Sprinkle the herbs in (2 tsp each of chopped rosemary, sage, and thyme) and mix until they are well distributed throughout the dough.
6. Grease a bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside to rise, 1-2 hours in a warm environment.
7. Once the dough has doubled in size, flour your countertop and dump the dough out.
8. Using a scraper or blunt knife, divide the dough into the desired number of fougasse. This quantity of dough will make 2 large fougasse, each taking up a half sheet pan. Or, you can make 3 or 4 smaller fougasse.
9. Flatten each piece of dough into a rough circle. Place it on a floured piece of parchment paper (it should not stick) and roll out the dough in a rough oval shape until it is about 1.5 cm thick. If the dough resists rolling, let it rest 10 minutes, then try again.
10. 
11. Flour your hands and shape the dough
12. Mix until mild gluten development (mostly smooth dough).
13. Cover and rest.
14. Apply 4 stretch-and-folds at 30 minute intervals, starting 30 minutes after the last step.
15. Immediately after the last stretch-and-fold, grease your pan with a generous amount of olive oil. Place the dough in the the greased pan and cover.
16. Let rise 4 hours, or until the dough is well-risen and soft to the touch.
17. Brush the dough with a light coating of olive oil and sprinkle some flaky salt. Add your toppings.
18. Bake at 400F/200C convection, or 425F/220C regular, for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
