A fougasse is a flat, crusty, beautifully shaped loaf of French origin. It is usually slashed to resemble an ear of wheat.

<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fresh_herb_fougasse_70351">Paul Hollywood's</a> recipe is easy to follow and takes only 2-3 hours.

Jeffrey Hamelman's recipe uses a páte fermentée, which requires more foresight and rise time.
