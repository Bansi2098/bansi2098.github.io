Use flaky salt and crumbled oregano leaves for topping.

# Method
1. Proof the 1 tsp yeast in 350 mL warm water.
2. Mix in the 1.5 tsp salt. 
3. Gradually mix in the 500 g flour, kneading by hand or machine until all the flour is picked up.
4. Add the 2 tsp olive oil and keep kneading until the dooth is mostly smooth, about 4 minutes by mixer.
5. Sprinkle the herbs in (2 tsp each of chopped rosemary, sage, and thyme) and mix until they are well distributed throughout the dough.
6. Grease a bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside to rise, 1-2 hours in a warm environment.
7. Once the dough has doubled in size, flour your countertop and dump the dough out.
8. Using a scraper or blunt knife, divide the dough into the desired number of fougasse. This quantity of dough will make 2 large fougasse, each taking up a half sheet pan. Or, you can make 3 or 4 smaller fougasse.
9. Flatten each piece of dough into a rough circle. Place it on a floured piece of parchment paper (it should not stick) and roll out the dough in a rough oval shape until it is about 1.5 cm thick. If the dough resists rolling, let it rest 10 minutes, then try again.
10. Using floured hands, gently shape the outer rim of the dough into your desired fougasse shape (oval, pointed egg, triangle). Scroll down for ideas.
11. Cover the dough and let rest 20 minutes.
12. Use a scraper, edge of a spatula, pizza cutter, or whatever is on hand, make several cuts in the dough to create the distinctive fougasse pattern (Scroll down for ideas.) Make sure cuts are at least 2 cm away from each other and the edge of the dough.
13. Gently stretch the dough to make it open up along the cuts. This will be the final shape of the fougasse.
16. Cover and rest 20 minutes while heating the oven to 400 F convection (205 C).
17. Brush olive oil over the dough. Sprinkly flaky sea salt and oregano on top.
18. Create steam in the oven (e.g. place a pan with boiling water in the oven).
19. Quickly put all the fougasse in the oven.
20. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the fougasse is golden brown on top and dry and hollow sounding on the bottom.
21. Place on a cooling rack, brush with more olive oil, and enjoy.
